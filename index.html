    <h1>Find largest rectangle</h1>
    <p>Here is the complete algorithm which search for the largest inscribed rectangle in a convex polygon. See the steps below :</p>
    <ol>1. Click on the screen to make points appear. Draw at least 3 points if you want to see something. The points do not have to be aligned or anything.</ol>
    <ol>2. Click on "I finished my polygon construction" to launch the convex hull algorithm. It is a pre-treatment such that we have the biggest convex polygon created by your points.</ol>
    <ol>3. You can create new points and enlarge your polygon by asking for the new convex hull.</ol>
    <ol>4. Click on "Find the largest rectangle" to launch the algorithm which will compute the largest rectangle possible. It will be drawn in green.</ol>

    <h1>Find epsilon-directions</h1>
    <p>Here is a part of the main algorithm : create epsilon-directions. However, the point of this implementation is to convince you that if we 
        draw enough random directions, we will have at least one of them close enough to the real direction of the rectangle we are looking for.
        Therefore, we start with the searched rectangle and show that the ratio determines how many points we take for the sets U and V,
        but also the length of the segment f1 f2.   </p>
    <ol>0. The expected rectangle is drawn. One of the green dots is the center s, the others (on the upper edge) are the points f1 and f2. They appear
        at first, even though you dit not choose a ratio yet, because the ratio is initially set to 1-5. </ol>    
    <ol>1. Choose a ratio by clicking on the buttons (1-1, 1-3, 1-5 or 1-10). This ratio determines how many points we will drawn for the U and V sets.
        NB: once you chose a ratio, you can not change it except by clearing.
    </ol>
    <ol>2. Click "Generate points" to compute random points to populate the sets U and V. U points are in red and V points in blue.</ol>    
    <ol>3. Click on "Show best directions" to launch the algorithm which checks if some paire u-v create epsilon-directions. If there exist any,
        they will appear in green, linking the red point u to the adequate blue v point. 
    </ol>
    <ol>4. Without clearing, you can always ask to generate new points and re-launch the verification of epsilon-directions.</ol>

    <h1>Find largest axis-aligned rectangle</h1>
    <p>Here is a part of the main algorithm :  finding the largest axis-aligned rectangle. The steps are exactly the same as for 
        "Find largest rectangle", the only difference is the fact that the rectangle must have parallel edges to the axe x. It is easier
        to implement but gives far worse results (the rectangle will not be as big as it could have been).
